make website to play a card game

## Frontend
1. HTML (the create and design structures and components)
2. Maybe Javascript?

## Backend
3. A tool to control sound
4. A tool to control Log In and Log Out
4. A tool to control the game algorithm

## Rule of Game
receive a total of 10 cards of character and potion cards in the beginning 

if speed is 20, able to use 2 cards in one turn, if 10, user is able to immediately use card at their turn but if speed is 5, have to skip their turn 

each 'character' card has spd, hp, atk, sp. atk attributes, each 'potion' card gives a buffer (def or spd or atk multiplier) and each 'spell' card tells user which atk to use (atk or sp.atk) 
[all spell cards have 20 spd]

game carries on every round until user.Score + op.Score = 11

whoever has highest percentage of character cards left wins the round

have to pick up attack cards from middle pile 


as soon as the card distribution,

roll the dice to choose which player goes first
then take whatever given on the stack i.e. sp attack / attack


getElementByClass("my-card") (but more precisely the character card) onClick

appears on the displayBoard (remain/keep the rotation)

max cards on display board = 4 cards (i.e. 2 char, 1 buffer, 1 middle)


you only roll the dice once when we start the game just only to choose which player goes first!


## display board: 

click one of the cards on the display board then it will be vibrated shortly to indicate that it cannot be moved (give a motion)

top of the screen, give notification say, cannot be replaced!

once the card is on the display board, it cannot be replaced nor removed (until it’s used)
